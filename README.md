## Homework!

This repository now contains my HTML and CSS files that I made for a homework project a little while ago. The HTML file contains a heading and a list of the requirements for that homework assignment, among a few other things. The CSS stylesheet makes it look more interesting by adding colors, space, borders, and font styles to the text, and putting a rainbow background behind some of it.

Let's add a pull request!
