## Homework!

This is my repository for doing and uploading my homework


If I add a line or two here, it will make a conflict.
But I can resolve it and then my pull request will be able to merge.

Let's make lots of commits!
If I keep adding things one at a time, I will have a bunch of commits from this branch.
And once I've got a bunch, I can squash them!
